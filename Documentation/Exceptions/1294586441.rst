TYPO3 Exception 1294586441
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Oops, an error occurred! "..." is not writable.
===============================================

This happens when your file permissions (Unix) are
not correct while including TypoScript from a file and trying to edit it in
the backend.

Solution: Change file permissions to make the file writeable
by the webserver, for example :bash:`chgrp www-data your/error/message/file && chmod g+w www-data`
or move the TypoScript to a location that can be written.
