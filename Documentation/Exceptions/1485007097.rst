   TYPO3 10 and before
   ===================

   You'll encounter this issue when configuring a TCA field of type `group` and forget to define
   the `internal_type` option to be either `db` or `folder`. This most likely happened because
   you were looking at a configuration exeample for TYPO3 > 10, where this is not neede anymore
   since group type `folder` has been removed.
