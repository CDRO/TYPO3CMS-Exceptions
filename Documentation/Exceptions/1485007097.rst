   TYPO3 10 and older - 2022-05-17
   ===============================

   You'll encounter this issue when configuring a TCA field of type `group` and forget to define
   the `internal_type` option to be either `db` or `folder`. This most likely happened because
   you were looking at a configuration example for TYPO3v12 or newer, where this was removed
   with the group type `folder`.
