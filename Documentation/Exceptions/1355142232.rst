The ColumnMap for property "..." of class "..." is missing

What this simply says is that you don't have such a field/property with
that spelling in your model for the table you are querying. Perhaps you
are using the exact spelling found in your table. You should instead use
the spelling in your model. Cross-check that you have such a field in
your model.
