Could not determine the current charset of the database.

Did you update MySQL last time and this exception occurred? First verify
if MySQL can check the charsets by running the following SQL query:

.. code-block:: sql

   SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set%';

If it shows you an error like :sql:`Table 'performance_schema.session_variables' doesn't exist`
you can try to fix it by the console command:

::

   mysql_upgrade -u root -p --force

After that, restart `mysql`.
