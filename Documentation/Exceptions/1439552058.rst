TYPO3 Exception 1439552058
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The extension "..." has invalid version constraints in depends section. Extension key is missing!
=================================================================================================

-  To fix this, go to your TYPO3 Installation directory, go to
   :file:`typo3conf/ext/...` and edit :file:`ext_emconf.php` and
   delete the line in the `depends` section, which neither contains
   any extension key nor any version, but only an empty array key with
   empty array value (`' ' => ' ',`). In my case this was line 31. ->
   Save the file.
-  After this go to your TYPO3 backend, go to the :guilabel:`extensions`
   subcategory and enable the extension by clicking the box in front of this entry.
-  Refresh your page, and you should be fine.
