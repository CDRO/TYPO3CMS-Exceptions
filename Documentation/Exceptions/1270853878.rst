   #1270853878: TYPO3 Fatal Error: Extension key "adodb" is NOT loaded!

Please check, whether you have downloaded and installed the called
extension (in this case "adodb") in the backend extension manager.

Additionally, clearing the complete Cache via the admin tool can help solve the
problem.

In general the error can be thrown if a dependency is
not met (means: a required extension is missing).

Non-supported versions
----------------------

If the extension is only for BE and depends on another extension such as
scheduler, one has to set in the :file:`ext_localconf.php` of that extension the
variable `doNotLoadInFE` to 1.
