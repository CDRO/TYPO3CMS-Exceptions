   #1588095935 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Http\Security\MissingReferrerException
   Missing referrer for /main

This error came up after logging into the backend or install tool after
updating from TYPO3 9.5.16 to 9.5.20. The error was caused by the feature
"security.backend.enforceReferrer" which was introduced in 9.5.17(?) and
is enabled by default.

Solution
--------

Disable the feature by editing :file:`LocalConfiguration.php`::

   'SYS' => [
           'features' => [
               'security.backend.enforceReferrer' => false,
           ],
   ]
