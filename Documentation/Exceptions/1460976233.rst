TYPO3 Exception 1460976233

In a custom content element, that doesn't check, if an image exists
this exception might be encountered if the image is missing.

The extension Camaliga is sensible for this issue. If you have assigned
a Gallery Map Element to a plugin and with this element is no image
connected, than you receive this error message. Look in your storage
folder with the Gallery Elements and check all Elements if they have an
image assigned. Check also all the translated elements in this folder.
