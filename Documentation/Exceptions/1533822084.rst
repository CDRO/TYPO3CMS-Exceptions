Argon2iPasswordHash is not available
====================================

The following exception may bubble up since TYPO3 v9 during login:

::

      #1533822084 TYPO3\CMS\Core\Crypto\PasswordHashing\InvalidPasswordHashException
      Configured default hash method
      TYPO3\CMS\Core\Crypto\PasswordHashing\Argon2iPasswordHash is not
      available. If the instance has just been upgraded, please log in to the
      standalone install tool at typo3/install.php to fix this.

Explanation
===========

If an instance has just been upgraded and if *argon2i* hash mechanism is
not available locally, the default backend will still try to upgrade a
given user password to *argon2i* if the install tool has not been
executed once.

Reasons
=======

This typically happens only if a system has just been upgraded and a
backend login is performed before the install tool has executed silent
upgarde wizards.

Solutions
=========

Please see :ref:`Password hashing troubleshooting
<t3coreapi:password-hashing_troubleshooting>`.
