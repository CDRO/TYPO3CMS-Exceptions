TYPO3 Exception 1382276561
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The package "..." depends on "..." which is not present in the system.
======================================================================

Solution 1
----------

Clear system caches

Solution 2
----------
The cache cannot be cleared, because both the TYPO3 backend
and the TYPO3 install tool are not available any more. Open the file
:file:`typo3conf/PackageStates.php` and remove the part which belongs to the
extension which requires the missing extension. If everything is finally
restored, then you can install this extension again manually.

Solution 3
----------
If deleting :file:`PackageStates.php` is no option, try using the
`typo3cms console` to re-install an extension which is already installed.
That should fix it.
