The path provided does not point to existing and accessible well-formed XML file.
=================================================================================

Check the XML file mentioned for formatting errors (for example with an XML Validator).
Occurs when a tag name is not well closed (example: `<label></labe>`).

This error might also occur if the file has the wrong encoding. Try to
use UTF-8 (without BOM). If the file is a language file, also check all
other language versions. For example, if the error is shown for
`locallang_db.xlf`, in fact, the error might be caused by `de.locallang_db.xlf`.
