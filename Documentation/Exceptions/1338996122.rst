TYPO3 Exception 1338996122
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

Package "..." is already registered.
====================================

Accidental double install
-------------------------

When installing extensions twice (for example by inadvertently using a copied folder)
this exception might occur. To get rid of it again, remove the extension from
the :file:`typo3conf/PackageStates.php` manually.

Duplicate :file:`composer.json` package name:

Another package uses the same name in its :file:`composer.json` file. Even if
`composer mode` is not enabled and the composer file is just copied, it
will cause the TYPO3 Package Manager to throw the correct exception.
This may happen if you copy an extension, e.g. from
:file:`typo3conf/ext/acme` to :file:`typo3conf/ext/acme.old`. Just search the
filesystem for any other instances of the same package name and rename
one of them.

.. warning::

   Composer files allow aliases for package names
   in the `replace` section, catch them as well.
