The RecordLinkHandler expects identifier and uid as $parameter configuration
============================================================================

   #1486155150: The RecordLinkHandler expects identifier and uid as
   $parameter configuration.

Happened during upgrade to TYPO3 version 8 in the migration wizard.

Reason
------

The Linkparser can't handle links to extension records, like

::

   <link record:tt_news:1 - internal-link>News Record</link>

Solution
--------

Search for records in database and change the link manually,
then run the migration wizard again.
