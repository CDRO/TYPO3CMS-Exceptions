TYPO3 Exception 1253191060

Could not get image resource for ...
====================================

A ViewHelper tries to load an non-existing image.

The exception is thrown in VHS package.

Try the find the Content Element with the missing file and replace it.

Sometimes a ViewHelper tries to generate an image and pass it to
the image ViewHelper. For example the :file:`vhs/Classes/ViewHelpers/Media/PdfThumbnailViewHelper.php` class tries
to generate a file in :file:`typo3temp/assets/...`.
Due to **wrong access right** it was not able to save the
file, passed it to the Image ViewHelper which then raised the exception.

.. note::

   The core ViewHelpers f:image and f:uri.image used to behave the
   same. However they don't throw exceptions for missing images anymore.
