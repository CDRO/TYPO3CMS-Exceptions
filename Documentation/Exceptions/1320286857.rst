File Record Wizard
------------------

This error occurs e.g. when a file-name contains an umlaut. By removing
the umlaut this can fix this issue. However, if it doesn't check the
other posted solutions in this entry.


RTE// CKEditor with Core v9+
----------------------------

This issue occurred to me by misusing the :sql:`softref` config within the
:sql:`bodytext` TCA configuration in an override. (in my concrete example)

This bug behaved like the following with the relevant content in line 1
of the :sql:`bodytext` editor input:

-  Saving 'test test' -> works
-  Saving 'testtest' -> error
-  Saving 'test' -> error

When :sql:`'softref'` is set to e.g. the :sql:`bodytext` field, the DataHandler
calls `updateRefIndexTable` of the ReferenceIndex. The Stacktrace leads
through the `SoftReferenceIndex` and its `getTypoLinkParts` function.
There the `TypoLinkCodecService` is called with `->decode(...)` This
functionality is used to resolve links, while it splits on spaces. This
is the reason why 'testtest' fails and 'test test' does not. 'testtest'
gets wrapped with it's p-Tags and results in invalid linkhandling while
'test test' gets split into '< p > test' which is not correct, but does
not throw an exception.

RTE
----

I noticed this issue when RTE had an incorrect link:

:html:`<link ../fileadmin/user_upload/documents/myhomeplan.pdf>`

TYPO3 specifically reported that the file path is incorrect and that
".." and "//" are not allowed in the beginning of file path.

This happened for us after we migrated from 4.5.x to 4.6.x.

-  Solution: Remove the invalid link via phpmyadmin or similar tools
-  Can affect: Any table, ex: news, tt_news etc...
-  Sometimes, we may even get into this situation when the file in
   question has been renamed/moved/missing.
