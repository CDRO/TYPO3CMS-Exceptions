Invalid value "..." for enumeration "..."
=========================================

TYPO3 6.2.x and higher (after update from 6.1 or lower)
-------------------------------------------------------

Error occurred in an extension after migration 6.1 -> 6.2 due to wrong
(invalid) field data types in the TCA (`'type' => 'date',`) -> `'date'` is an
invalid type. It seems, v6.1 didn't care very much about invalid types,
but 6.2 does. Changing the datatype to `'type' => 'input', 'eval' => 'datetime'`
solved the problem.
