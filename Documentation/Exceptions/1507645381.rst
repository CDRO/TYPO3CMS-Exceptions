Cause of error: BOM in ext_conf_template.txt
--------------------------------------------

This exception got thrown in TYPO3 9.5.5, when the :file:`ext_conf_template.txt`
file contained a BOM (byte order mark) character at beginning of the
file and the Extension Configuration was fetched using the
ExtensionConfiguration API.
