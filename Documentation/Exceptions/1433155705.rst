TYPO3 Exception 1433155705

Element "..." already has a resolver registered with priority "..."
===================================================================

This happens, if two `NodeResolvers` with the same priority for the same
element have been registered, for example when installing two RTEs (like
ckeditor and tinymce). Remove one of them and everything works again.
