TYPO3 Exception 1439555561
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The composer.json found for extension "..." is invalid!
=======================================================

A :file:`composer.json` file has a syntax error. Use the command line
:bash:`composer.phar validate` to get details about this error and the line
number which causes this error.

This error can also occur if the :file:`composer.json` file is not accessible.

Alternatively, use a JSON online validator and copy-paste the contents of your
:file:`composer.json`. Then you will see the exact syntax error in this JSON
file. E.g. `here <https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/>`__.
