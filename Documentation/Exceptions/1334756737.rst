TYPO3 Exception 1334756737

The temporary cache file "..." could not be written.
====================================================

-  Check your quota.
-  Check if filesystem is full.
-  Check if the filesystem permissions are correct.

Troubleshooting: Log on to the console or ftp as the user that runs php
and try to create the file. Add some text to the file so it has more
than 0 bytes.

The solution was to grant owner rights for the directory: :file:`typo3conf`, :file:`typo3temp`, :file:`fileadmin` and uploads to PHP-User. You can also check permissions with the TYPO3 install tool.

The problem can also occur when there is not enough space on hard disk.
Try to expand the hard disk drive or delete some unnecessary files.
