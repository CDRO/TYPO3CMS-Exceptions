Cannot add a file that is already part of this storage.

FAL: addFile()
--------------

Error when adding a :sql:`sys_file` to a FAL storage
via `$this->storage->addFile($localFilePath, $targetFolder, $targetFileName)`:

The problem was that the first parameter `$localFilePath` was an absolute
path instead of a relative path.

-  Wrong: :file:`my/absolute/path/www/fileadmin/myfile.jpg`
-  Correct: :file:`fileadmin/myfile.jpg`
