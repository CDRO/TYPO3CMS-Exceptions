==============================================

This exception can occur due to at least three reasons:

-  Bug #51747 (https://forge.typo3.org/issues/51747) in  TYPO3 6.1.4
-  a folder in :file:`typo3temp` or :file:`fileadmin` that actually is write-protected
-  The folder isn't write-protected but completely missing.

Possible missing folders are

-  :file:`typo3temp/_processed\_`
-  :file:`typo3temp/_migrated\_`
-  :file:`fileadmin/_processed\_`
-  :file:`fileadmin/_migrated\_`
