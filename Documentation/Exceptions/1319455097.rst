Error while fetching permissions for "..."
==========================================

Issue occurs because of offline filestorage
-------------------------------------------

Go to page 0 and check your file storage records. If they are offline at
the moment, set them online. After saving check whether they are still
offline. If this is the case, check whether the defined file path exists
on the system. TYPO3 will set file storages offline if they can't be
"mounted" because they are not there.

After the folder exists and the record is set to online, the issue
should be solved in most cases.

Unicode files
--------------

It maybe connected to unicode file names handling - it can happen with
names like :file:`Økonomi.jpg`. If you have such file in folder then you can
have following error message:

In this case check 2 things:

#. Settings in config should contain:
   `[SYS][UTF8filesystem] = true`
   `[SYS][systemLocale] = 'en_US.utf8'`

#. See in server's shell whether your file system supports
   unicode/utf-8 names, using for example command 'locale'

UTF-8 problems
--------------

UTF-8 named files may become damaged/mangled upon transferring them via
(S)FTP. For example using Transmit/Coda between OS X and a linux server.
Use scp, rsync or lftp to transfer such files. Alternatively, also
compressing them in a tar.gz for the move may
help.

Default storage setting missing
-------------------------------

Problem occurred for me after updating from TYPO3 6.2.10 to 6.2.11 and
6.2.12 – contrary to https://forge.typo3.org/issues/58403#note-3 I
re-created a file storage for ``/``, but without setting it as default
(``fileadmin/`` is still the default storage).

Migrate all RTE magic images
============================

Got this exception during update 4.5.40 to 6.2.12 at "Migrate all RTE
magic images from :file:`uploads/RTEmagicC_\*` to :file:`fileadmin/_migrated/RTE/".`

*Solution*: Delete unwanted entries from :sql:`sys_file_storage`.

Remove /uploads from filemounts
===============================

Remove the uploads-folder from filemounts, log out and log in.
