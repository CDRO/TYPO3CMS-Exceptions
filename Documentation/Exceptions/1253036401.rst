TYPO3 Exception 1253036401

argument "*path*" was already defined and should not be defined again
=====================================================================

This error ( argument "*path*" was already defined and should not be
  defined again ) is caused by an extension viewhelper registering its'
  arguments differently after an upgrade. Clear the cache from install
  tool solves it.

This error occurred, after upgrading from TYPO3 CMS 7 to 8 having a
custom view helper extending
`TYPO3\CMS\Fluid\ViewHelpers\ImageViewHelper`. The registering of
arguments changed from CMS 7 to 8. In 7 most of the arguments where
defined in the signature of the `render()` method. That changed in CMS
8. In my view helper the arguments were still in the signature causing
this error.
