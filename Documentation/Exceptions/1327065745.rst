Changed Caching
---------------

Caching TCA information changed in TYPO3 v8.

Solution:
^^^^^^^^^

From the core `API
docs <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/ApiOverview/Categories/Index.html#making-a-table-categorizable>`__:

The second way is to call
`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::makeCategorizable()`.
This method adds a new entry into the registry managed by
`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Category\CategoryRegistry`. The registry will take care
of adding the relevant `$TCA` definition to create a field for making
relations to the system categories. The call to **makeCategorizable()
must be located in an extension's Configuration/TCA/Overrides folder**
(or :file:`ext_tables.php` file before TYPO3 CMS 6.2.1).

Wrong Relation
--------------

Use of 1:1 relation in domain model but querying it as a n:m relation.

Solution:
^^^^^^^^^

The query must use `equals()` for 1:1 relation. If you use `contains()`
extbase will expects a 1:n or n:m relation.
