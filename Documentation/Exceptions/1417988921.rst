Page module not working (TYPO3 7.x - fixed in newer versions)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Create your first page in the List-tab. Afterwards it will work in the
Page-tab too. Copied from this german thread:
https://forum.typo3.org/index.php/t/210486/

Other Workaround, which applies for 7.4.0:

-  Export (to :file:`.t3d`) a single leaf page from another TYPO3 CMS instance
   (mine was 6.2)
-  Right click root element in :guilabel:`page tree` => :guilabel:`Import from .t3d`
   (I imported only page properties)
-  Now I can append other pages to that page by using the :guilabel:`New`
   operation (which failed before)
-  I can even add pages (with :guilabel:`New` to the root element which did not
   work before.

Still, none of my pages is tagged as :guilabel:`Use as Root Page` in
:guilabel:`Page Properties` > :guilabel:`Behaviour` =>
It does not have to do with "Root Page".
Instead, at least one page must exist to get rid of the Bug (as a
workaround).

Limitation: When I delete all pages in the page tree, and then try to
right-click-:guilabel:`New` => I hit the error again. Basically this means that
this workaround only works as long as you don't delete all pages.

See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66704. When there is a fix available
and released, an update should do.
