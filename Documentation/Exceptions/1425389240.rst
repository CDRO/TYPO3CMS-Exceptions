TYPO3 Exception 1425389240
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The requested resource "..." was not found.
===========================================

Affected: 7.4.0 and 7.5.0-dev and maybe earlier versions.

See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66704

Limitation: When I delete all pages in the page tree, and then try to
right-click-"New" => I hit the error again. Basically this means that
this workaround only works as long as you don't delete all pages.

As soon as https://forge.typo3.org/issues/66704 is fixed and the
corresponding version released, an update might fix the problem.
