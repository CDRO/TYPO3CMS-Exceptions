No file found for given UID.

TYPO3 CMS 6.1.2: Error while uploading previously deleted file
--------------------------------------------------------------

Having deleted a specific file before at the :file:`fileadmin` it's not
possible to upload the same file again without error "No file found
for given UID.".
You can't open the :file:`fileadmin` folder containing the file once again
uploaded afterwards.
At the :sql:`sys_file` table the misbehaving file's entry shows "deleted = 1"
before and after upload.
Workaround: Deleting the :sql:`sys_file` entry of that file via phpMyadmin.
This is forcing TYPO3 :file:`fileadmin` to create a new sys_file entry with a
different uid. Now the folder and itÂ´s content are available again.

TYPO3 CMS 6.2.x - happened when a tt_news entry had an non-existing image in the bodytext
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For some reason the preview did still exist and was shown in BE when
editing the news record. But in FE this lead to the exception, because
the sys_file record was not there anymore.

EXT:solr + EXT:solrfal
----------------------

The exception happened when initializing :file:`fileadmin/` queue. File record
was missing in sys_file but existed in :sql:`sys_file_reference` and
:sql:`sys_file_processedfile`. The following SQL helped:

.. code-block:: sql

   delete from sys_file_reference where uid_local not in (select uid from
   sys_file); truncate sys_file_processedfile;

The exception can also happen when there are non-existing files for
indexing in :sql:`tx_solr_indexqueue_file` and the the records are not deleted with
"Clear Index Queue" for unknown reasons. This SQL helped:

.. code-block:: sql

   truncate tx_solr_indexqueue_file;
