You are not allowed to delete the file "..."
=============================================

FAL checks for sufficient user rights. The user is not allowed
to see the folder or file or has no permissions to delete
files in the given folder.

Solution:

-  Add a file mount for this folder and give it to the
   user/usergroup. This however means that the user may see \*all\*
   files in the folder, not only his own.
-  Make sure the user has sufficient access permissions to that folder.
