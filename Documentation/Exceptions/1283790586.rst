There is no entry in the $TCA array for the table "your_unknown_table"
======================================================================

 Exception 1283790586 **'There is no entry in the $TCA array for the
 table "your_unknown_table". This means that the function enableFields()
 is called with an invalid table name as argument.'**

This exception is thrown in `TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\Page\PageRepository::enableFields` when the table (as
mentioned in the error) is not found in the TCA.

Possible causes
===============

Your project uses:

-  PHP-code with `enableFields('your_unknown_table')`.
-  TypoScript-code with an unknown table in a CONTENT-object. There
   might be an indication of this in the backtrace, f.e. `TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\ContentObject\ContentObjectRenderer::cObjGetSingle("CONTENT",
   array, "30")` indicates that an unknown table is used in a
   CONTENT element with the name '30'.

-  Backtrace is the detailed error output when dev mode is enabled in
   the install tool. I searched it for "array" and found this:
   TypoScript Code `TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\ContentObject\ContentObjectRenderer::cObjGetSingle("TEMPLATE",
   array, "100")`. Now I searched my templates for the string "100". It
   was the main page template, and I found some `temp.` objects that were
   defined as `temp.myobject = CONTENT`, but due to some conditions, in
   some cases, had no further definition. TYPO3 4.5 could live with
   that, 6.2 threw an error.

Bad:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   temp.item = CONTENT
   [globalVar = LIT:1 = {$constant}]
   temp.item {
   }
   [global]

Less bad:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   temp.item =
   [globalVar = LIT:1 = {$constant}]
   temp.item =CONTENT
   temp.item {
   }
   [global]
