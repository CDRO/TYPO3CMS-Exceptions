This might habben when there is an error in the TypoScript. For example
the following has a line break where there should be none:

*Wrong*:

.. code-block::typoscript

    # cat=basic/enable/020; type=boolean; label=Activate the feature:
    Enables the feature
    feature = 0

*Correct*:

.. code-block::typoscript

    # cat=basic/enable/020; type=boolean; label=Activate the feature: Enables the feature
    feature = 0
