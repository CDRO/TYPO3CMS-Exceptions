RealURL is not able to find the root page id for the given domain
=================================================================

RealURL searches in the sys_domain table for a domain with matches the
current host. It would then detect the PID of the domain record and
hence get the root page of the domain.

If this exception is thrown, then

-  either no domain record exists for the current domain (solution: add
   domain record)
-  or a proxy modifies the host of the request and RealURL cannot find it
   (solution: check what RealURL uses to match a domain, check for
   proxies, maybe add a domain record)
-  or RealURL cant handle ports in the domain (eg: localhost:8023 -
   currently no other solution than switching to a host without ports or
   overwrite the ConfigurationReader class)
