TYPO3 Exception 1596980032
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

**Error message:**

::

       #1596980032 InvalidArgumentException
       A cache identifier was not set.

When debuging the corresponding cache.definition might look like this:

::

       '' => array('groups' => array('pages', 'all'))

This error can break the backend and frontend.

| 
| **The reason**

Before TYPO3 version 10 it was common that the variable :php:`$_EXTKEY` was
replaced automatically by the extension key of the corresponding
extension.

This has changed and the variable either has to be defined or the 
extension key automatically applied.

As the variable :php:`$_EXTKEY` was undefined, the array key for 
the cache definition was empty.

The error was therefore caused by an incomplete extension-update.

| 
| **How to fix**

Search in all extensions for usage of $_EXTKEY in the file
ext_localconf.php.

If the variable is used but not defined in that file, define it in the
beginning or replace it by the extension-key.
