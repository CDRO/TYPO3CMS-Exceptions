Misspelled folder name in icon path
===================================

I've encountered the exception that "source" is mandatory during icon
rendering.

This was because I misspelled a folder name in the icon path using
"EXT:...".

It could not be resolved and therefore the icon path was empty in the
end.

Cache
=====

Clearing the cache via the install tool fixed the error for me

Other
=====

I received following exception when I installed the following extension
:file:`svconnector`.

I had a similar problem with the same error-code but in a local ddev
server. I used ddev v. 0.18.0 - where the error came out and updated to
ddev 1.3.0 there the error was gone.
