No cache in the specified group "..."
=====================================

This happens if `flushCachesInGroup` is called with a group that has no caches
defined.

Possible Solutions:
-------------------

-  If you recently installed new extensions, try uninstalling them and clearing the cache.
-  If you are a developer, check the error message for the `groupIdentifier` and verify
   that the cache group exists.
