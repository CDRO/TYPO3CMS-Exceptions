Template is not writeable
=========================

Happens when your file permissions (Unix) are not correct if you include
TypoScript from a file and try to edit it in the backend.

Solution: Change file permissions to make the file writeable by the
webserver or move the file to a writable location. For example, if you need
to make changes on TypoScript of an extension you should not do it in the extension
directly but in your own template files.
