Default language record with id X not found in table Y while editing record Z
=============================================================================

This message is a result of an data inconsistency. This happens if the
translation parent in default language has been deleted without deleting the
translation that is currently being edited. Please contact your support for
further help (if you are the support: either remove the translation parent
manually in the database, restore the parent record or discard the translations, too).
