Lock file could not be created
==============================

This may happen because

- disk is full
- the deprecation log or other log files are unusually large
- the location for lock files is read-only

To solve this error, make sure enough disk space is available and the location
for lock files is writable by the server. If the deprecation log is the problem,
disable the deprecation log temporarily until you have fixed the errors.
