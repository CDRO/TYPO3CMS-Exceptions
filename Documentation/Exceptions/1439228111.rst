Composer install with "--no-scripts" option
-------------------------------------------

Probably you tried to run a :bash:`composer install/update` using the
:bash:`--no-scripts` option.

.. code-block:: bash

   composer install --no-scripts

Try to run :bash:`composer install` again without the :bash:`--no-scripts` option.

.. code-block:: bash

   composer install
