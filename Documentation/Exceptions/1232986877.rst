TYPO3 Exception 1232986877
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

This happened after configuring TYPO3 6.2 to use the APC Backend
for Extbase Cache and afterwards disabling the APC Cache module on the
server. Solution is to re-enable the APC or delete the cache
configuration from :file:`LocalConfiguration.php`. Don't forget to clear the
:file:`typo3temp/Cache` afterwards.

This error will also occur if your apc cache runs out of memory - either
give it more or as a quick temp fix clear out the cache with a minimal
script like::

   <?php apc_clear_cache();?>
