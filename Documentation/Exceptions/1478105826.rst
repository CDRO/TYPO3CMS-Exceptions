TYPO3 Exception 1478105826
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

This error can happen when using the variable :php:`$_EXTKEY` in a TCA
definition like :file:`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content.php` without
defining it. In TYPO3 versions before 8 the variable was automatically
defined.

Solution
--------

Replace all occurences of :php:`$_EXTKEY` with the extension's name or
define the variable locally.
