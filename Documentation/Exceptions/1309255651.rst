TYPO3 Exception 1309255651

Invalid type encountered: "..."
===============================

The provided phpdoc annotation contains a type that is not recognized.

This can e.g. happen if you model contains properties of the type `Date` instead
of `DateTime` - edit the model and make sure that only known and valid types are used.

Known and valid types are PHP simple types (like `int` or `float`) or class names.

Take care af annotations in getters, setters and class-property
declarations.
