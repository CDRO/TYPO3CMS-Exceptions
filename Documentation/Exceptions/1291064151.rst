Could not write to file "typo3temp/mail.mbox" when sending an email to debug transport
======================================================================================

The filepath given in `[MAIL][transport_mbox_file]` needs to be
**absolute** and writeable.

In the example above is was enough to use `/var/www/typo3temp/mail.mbox` as path.
