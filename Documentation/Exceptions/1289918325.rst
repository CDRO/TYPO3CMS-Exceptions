#1289918325: Module 'my_module' is not configured.
==================================================

This message appears when trying to load a module from BE context
menu. The module was configured in :file:`Route.php` and loaded via
`BackendControllerHook`.

This problem appears when changing a module name or when old module names are
still cached (for example when upgrading the TYPO3 core or extensions).

The solution is to clear all caches (either via the install tool or if that
does not help via manually removing the files in :file:`typo3temp`).
