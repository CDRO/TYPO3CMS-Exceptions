TYPO3 Exception 1260881688
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The error occurs if there is a newly created Domain Object where the
attribute uid is not set. This happens because newly created Domain
Objects were not persisted directly after adding them to a repository.
You have to get an instance of the PersistenceManager ::

   $persistenceManager = $this->objectManager->get('TYPO3\\CMS\\Extbase\\Persistence\\Generic\\PersistenceManager')

and persist it by hand with `$persistenceManager->persistAll()`.
