TYPO3 Exception 1439288036
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

An item in field "..." of table "..." is not an array as expected
=================================================================

This happens in TYPO3 7.6 if there is a incompatible 'items' TCA
definition in the according field like

.. code-block:: php

   'items' => [
       '0' => '-'
   ]

or

.. code-block:: php

   'items' => ['-']

This has to be replaced with a correct item definition like

.. code-block:: php

   'items' => [
       ['-', 0]
   ]
