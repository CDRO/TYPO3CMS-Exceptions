TYPO3 Exception 550
===================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

May happen if an extension converts a HTTP error code to an exception code.

   Oops, an error occurred! Expected response code 250 but got code "550",
   with message "550 5.7.60 SMTP; Client does not have permissions to send
   as this sender

In this case, the `FE_Manager` tries to send a notification to the admin and the
sender address or mail server information doesn't match the requirements.
