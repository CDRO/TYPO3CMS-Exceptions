TYPO3 Exception 1337280417
==========================

.. include:: /If-you-encounter-this-exception.rst.txt

The extension install path "%s" was no directory!
=================================================

Problem occurs when extension size is more than `post_max_size` (php.ini).
Just fix `post_max_size` and restart webserver.

TYPO3 Internals: Actually error should be reported at
`\TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Controller\UploadExtensionFileController::extractAction`
if `$_FILES['tx_extensionmanager_tools_extensionmanagerextensionmanager']` is
null.
