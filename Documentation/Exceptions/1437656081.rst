Record with uid "..." from table "..." not found
================================================

Wrong sys_file_reference PID of related records
-----------------------------------------------

A file reference used in record which had a pid to a non existing page.
In my example we have migrated :sql:`tx_news` images to FAL and some
:sql:`sys_file_reference` entries have been created. No sure why, but we ended
up wrong pid values for our created :sql:`sys_file_reference` entry. This can
be fixed by adjusting :sql:`sys_file_reference` pid value to sysfolder uid of
related news record with an SQL statement.
