TYPO3 Exception 1294587218

ServiceUnavailable: TypoScriptFrontendController
================================================

TypoScript is the language, in which the internal object structure in
TYPO3 CMS is described (not the HTML DOM). Each page needs at least one
TypoScript template either in its own properties or in an upward page.

So you need at least one page and a "root level" template record with
some content.

If you have both, go through the following:

First, check wether the page you don't see or at least one of the pages
in root-direction has a TypoScript template which works, is active and
has root-level property. To achieve this, go to the following window:

:guilabel:`Template` Module in the left column > :guilabel:`page` is selected in middle column
> :guilabel:`info/edit` in top selection field > :guilabel:`edit complete template record` >
"General" - tab

-  check the template TypoScript code in the "Setup" - text field
-  The "inactive" field must be unchecked.
-  Check, whether root-level property is set in the "Options" tab: the
   "root level" field must be checked.

If all this is o.k., but the error occurs nonetheless, you may delete
and re-create the root template.

Delete the root template with the little trash bin on top of template
edit page.

Then create a new template by clicking "Create template for new
website". This button has appeared after deleting the root template.

Additionally, you find many information in the docs on TYPO3.org

SOLUTION 1 (Tested with TYPO3 7+)
=================================

#. In the backend, click on 'Template' menu under web module.
#. Click on the main page (usually id 1)
#. Select *Info/Modify* in the dropdown menu on the header section of
   the content pane.
#. Click on the *Edit the whole template record* button.
#. Click on the *Options* tab.
#. Make sure to select *Rootlevel* checkbox. Problem solved.
