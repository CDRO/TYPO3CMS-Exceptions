If you've gotten this error message

::

   Oops, an error occurred!

   The PHP extension "apc" or "apcu" must be installed and loaded in order to use the APC backend.

Then there are two methods, which will work.

#. Install and configure apc on the server. Maybe APC is installed, but
   needs more memory.
#. Goto TYPO3 *Install Tool* --> *Configuration Presets* and
   choose *Database cache backend* (or: something different then `apc`) and save.
